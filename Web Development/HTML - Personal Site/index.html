        <p>I am a finance professioal working in the mortgage sector. My work is focused on a client facing leadership type role where I not only interact with our clients but leading a staff as well. My work is supported by accomplishments such as
          top
          sales leader within my national territory, top 5% of sales within the entire organization, leadership accolades for month-over-month growth, and the development of the Senior Mortgage position within our tech and sales departments. I was
          originally raised on the beaches in Florida where I was obsessed with outdoor activities and anything that took place in a body of water. Now, I reside in Dallas, Texas and enjoy not only my professional life but take great interests in
          being
          outdoors, spending time with family, traveling, and watching sports such as football and F1. My current goal is to learn web development and become a full stack engineer! </p>
